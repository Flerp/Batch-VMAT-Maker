# Batch-VMAT-Maker
 
This is a bulk VMAT Maker
It creates materials using the complex shader, by default


## Instructions
1. Place texture files in /sbox/addons/addonname/materials/basetexturefiles/
2. Place script next to texture files (tif, tga, png, psd)
3. Run Script

vmats will be placed in /sbox/addons/addonname/materials/

Feel free to tweak as you see fit



## PBR Version
This works the same as the standard one, but with all PBR aspects.
It expects the following:
1. All image files are the same format
2. file suffixes match S&box's best practices (_color, _metal, _ao, etc)
